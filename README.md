# Ingredient Scanner
This is the software artefact for my dissertation project at Bournemouth University.
The project explored accessibility and usability in mobile phone applications.

The product is a prototype android application that allows users to scan a list of ingredients using their phone camera or saved photos.
The application will then dispay which ingredients are suitable for them based on specified dietary needs.
Accessibility settings such as variable text size and colour, background colour, and colourblind mode are implemented.

Screenshots showing the application can be found in the Screenshots Folder.
